const sceneDescription = "A pristine bedroom bathed in warm, golden hour sunlight streaming through large bay windows, creating dramatic shadows and highlights across the freshly cleaned space. A person stands beside a perfectly made bed with crisp, hospital-corner sheets and plump, down-filled pillows arranged with military precision. A modern Dyson vacuum cleaner sits prominently in the foreground on a spotless hardwood floor, its sleek design reflecting the natural light. Books are organized alphabetically on a minimalist desk, and clothes hang perfectly in an open walk-in closet. The room exudes a sense of accomplishment and tranquility, with soft shadows creating depth and dimension. The scene captures the moment of completion, with every detail suggesting care and attention to order. The composition follows the rule of thirds, with the bed as the focal point, and the lighting creates a warm, inviting atmosphere that feels both professional and personal.";
