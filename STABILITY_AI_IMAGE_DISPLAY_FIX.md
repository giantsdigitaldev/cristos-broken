# Stability AI Image Display Fix

## Issues Identified

1. **API Error**: Stability AI API was rejecting requests with `steps: 75` (maximum allowed is 50)
2. **Image Display Issue**: Project details page wasn't showing generated images because it was looking in the wrong place
3. **TypeScript Interface**: Missing `cover_image_url` property in Project type

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed API Configuration
**File**: `utils/aiServices/stabilityAIService.ts`
- Changed `steps: 75` to `steps: 50` in `GENERATION_CONFIG`
- This resolves the 400 Bad Request error: `"steps: must be no greater than 50"`

### 2. Fixed Image Display Logic
**File**: `app/projectdetails.tsx`
- Updated image source logic to check `project.cover_image_url` first
- Added fallback to `project.metadata?.ai_generated_cover?.imageUrl`
- This ensures generated images are displayed properly

### 3. Updated TypeScript Interface
**File**: `utils/projectTypes.ts`
- Added `cover_image_url?: string` property to Project interface
- This resolves TypeScript compilation errors

## How It Works

1. **Image Generation**: StabilityAIService generates images and saves them to `cover_image_url` field
2. **Database Storage**: Images are stored in Supabase with public URLs
3. **Display Logic**: Project details page now checks:
   - First: `project.cover_image_url` (primary location)
   - Second: `project.metadata?.ai_generated_cover?.imageUrl` (fallback)
   - Third: `project.metadata?.image` (legacy)
   - Last: `images.projectImage` (default)

## Testing

The fixes should resolve:
- ✅ API calls to Stability AI now work (steps ≤ 50)
- ✅ Generated images appear in project details
- ✅ TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Real-time updates work when images are generated

## Next Steps

1. Test creating a new project to verify image generation works
2. Check that generated images appear in project details page
3. Verify real-time updates work when images are generated in background
