- Provide a help button in the chat and project modals.
- Link to a searchable FAQ covering common questions and troubleshooting.

### Tooltips and Contextual Guidance
- Show tooltips for new or complex features (e.g., "Click the orb to start speaking").
- Offer contextual hints as the user progresses through the flow.

### Contact/Support Escalation
- Allow users to contact support directly from the app if they encounter issues.
- Optionally, escalate to a human agent if the AI cannot resolve a problem.

### User Education for AI/Voice Features
- Provide short videos or animations demonstrating how to use AI and voice input.
- Remind users they can always switch between voice and text.

## AI Prompt Engineering

### Project Creation Interview Prompt Template
```text
You are an expert project manager AI. Interview the user to gather all required information to create a new project. Ask questions naturally, one at a time, and use context from previous answers. When the user provides information about tasks, subtasks, or team members, wrap each in HTML tags (e.g., <task1>...</task1>, <subtask1>...</subtask1>, <team_member1>...</team_member1>). Only ask for missing required fields. Confirm with the user before creating the project.

Example:
AI: What would you like to name your new project?
User: "Home Renovation"
AI: Great! Can you describe your project in a few sentences?
User: "I want to remodel my kitchen and bathroom."
AI: <project_name>Home Renovation</project_name> <project_description>I want to remodel my kitchen and bathroom.</project_description>
```

### Task/Subtask Extraction Prompt Template
```text
When the user mentions tasks or subtasks, extract them and wrap each in HTML tags. If the user lists multiple tasks or subtasks, number them accordingly. Ask for confirmation before adding them to the project.

Example:
User: "I need to buy tiles, hire a plumber, and paint the walls."
AI: <task1>Buy tiles</task1> <task2>Hire a plumber</task2> <task3>Paint the walls</task3>
Are these the tasks you want to add? You can edit or confirm.
```

### Team Member Role Assignment Prompt Template
```text
When the user mentions team members, search for existing users by name/email. Suggest roles based on context, but always ask for confirmation. Wrap each team member in a tag with their role.

Example:
User: "Raymond Underwood and Dan Schmidt will join."
AI: <team_member1 name="Raymond Underwood" role="admin" /> <team_member2 name="Dan Schmidt" role="lead" />
Should Raymond be the admin and Dan the lead? You can change their roles or confirm.
```

### Error Handling/Clarification Prompt Template
```text
If the user provides ambiguous or invalid information, ask a clarifying question. If a required field is missing, prompt for it. If an error occurs, explain clearly and suggest a solution.

Example:
User: "Set the due date to yesterday."
AI: The due date cannot be in the past. What date should I use for the deadline?

User: "Add John twice."
AI: John is already on the team. Should I remove the duplicate?
```

## Voice UX Details

### Always-On Voice Detection Logic
- Use Whisper AI for real-time speech-to-text.
- Voice orb listens when user is in the chat input or when toggled on.
- Pause listening when modal is open or user disables voice.
- Use voice activity detection to avoid false triggers.

### Animated Voice Orb UI States
- **Idle:** Orb is static, waiting for input.
- **Listening:** Orb pulses or animates to indicate active listening.
- **Processing:** Orb spins or changes color while transcribing.
- **Error:** Orb flashes red or shows an error icon if transcription fails.

### Fallback to Text
- If voice input fails, show a message: "Voice input not recognized. Please try again or type your message."
- Allow seamless switch to text input at any time.

### User Toggling Between Voice/Text
- Toggle button in chat input to switch between voice and text modes.
- Show current mode clearly (e.g., microphone icon for voice, keyboard icon for text).
- Remember user preference for next session.

### Error Handling for Voice Input
- If background noise or silence is detected, prompt user to speak clearly.
- If Whisper API is unavailable, disable voice and show fallback message.
- Log all voice input errors for debugging and improvement.

## LangChain/LangGraph Advanced Use

### Multi-User Chat Memory
- Store and retrieve chat history for each user and project.
- Enable context-aware responses based on previous interactions.
- Plan for future support of team chat memory (multiple users per project).

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Use LangChain to retrieve relevant project templates and documentation.
- Summarize long chat histories and provide only relevant context to Claude.
- Enable dynamic retrieval of historical project data for suggestions.

### Workflow Branching for Project Types
- Use LangGraph to define different interview flows for various project types (e.g., software, construction, event planning).
- Allow the AI to branch and adapt questions based on user responses and project context.

### Future: Team Chat & Check-In Agent
- Plan for an agent that monitors team chat, detects task completions, and prompts for project updates.
- Enable periodic check-ins with users to assess project/task status and suggest next actions.
- Integrate with "Today's Tasks" and location/context-aware suggestions (e.g., Home Depot shopping list).

## User Control & Flexibility

### Skipping Questions
- User can skip any non-required question at any time.
- AI should recognize "skip" or "not now" and move to the next relevant topic.

### Editing/Deleting Project Elements
- All widgets (tasks, team members, etc.) are editable via modal.
- User can delete any element with confirmation.
- Edits and deletions are reflected in both UI and database in real time.

### Restarting Project Creation
- User can restart the project creation flow at any time.
- AI should confirm before discarding current progress.

### Exporting Project Data
- Allow user to export project data (JSON, CSV, or PDF).
- Export option available in project summary modal or settings.

### Undo/Redo Actions
- Support undo/redo for recent actions in the chat/project flow.
- Show a simple UI for undo/redo (e.g., arrows or swipe gestures).

### Smart Defaults and Suggestions
- Pre-fill fields based on previous projects or user preferences.
- AI suggests likely team members, categories, or deadlines based on context.

## Accessibility & Internationalization

### VoiceOver/Screen Reader Support
- All chat, widgets, and modals should be accessible via screen readers.
- Provide descriptive labels for all interactive elements.

### High-Contrast and Large Text Modes
- Support high-contrast color schemes for visually impaired users.
- Allow users to increase text size throughout the app.

### Keyboard Navigation
- Ensure all UI elements are navigable via keyboard (tab, arrows, enter, etc.).
- Provide visible focus indicators for accessibility.

### Language Support and Future i18n
- Start with English (US) as default.
- Structure all prompts, UI text, and AI responses for easy translation.
- Plan for future support of multiple languages and right-to-left layouts.

### Accessibility Testing
- Regularly test with screen readers and accessibility tools.
- Include accessibility checks in CI/CD pipeline.
