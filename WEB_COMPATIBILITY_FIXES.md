# Web Compatibility Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sharp Module Compatibility Error
**Problem**: The Pollinations AI service was trying to use the Sharp image processing library, which doesn't work in web browsers.

**Error**: 
```
Could not load the "sharp" module using the undefined-undefined runtime
Dynamic require defined at line 24; not supported by Metro
```

**Solution**: 
- Removed Sharp dependency from `callPollinationsAI` method in `utils/aiServices/pollinationsAIService.ts`
- Replaced Sharp-based image cropping with web-compatible approach
- Images are now used as-is from Pollinations API (which already provides good quality)

### 2. Local API Server Connection Errors
**Problem**: The app was trying to connect to a local API server at `http://localhost:3001/api/gpt` that doesn't exist.

**Error**:
```
POST http://localhost:3001/api/gpt net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

**Solution**:
- Modified `utils/aiServices/gpt4o-mini-service.ts` to always use OpenAI API directly
- Modified `utils/chatService.ts` to always use OpenAI API directly
- Removed localhost server dependency

### 3. TypeScript Linter Errors
**Problem**: Potential undefined values in base64 data handling.

**Solution**:
- Added null checks for `apiResult.base64` before using it
- Added proper error handling for missing image data

## Files Modified

### 1. `utils/aiServices/pollinationsAIService.ts`
- Removed Sharp import and usage
- Added web-compatible image processing
- Added null checks for base64 data
- Improved error handling

### 2. `utils/aiServices/gpt4o-mini-service.ts`
- Removed localhost server logic
- Always use OpenAI API directly
- Simplified endpoint selection

### 3. `utils/chatService.ts`
- Removed localhost server logic
- Always use OpenAI API directly
- Simplified proxy server availability check

## Benefits

1. **Web Compatibility**: The app now works correctly in web browsers without Sharp dependency
2. **No Local Server Required**: All API calls go directly to OpenAI, no local server needed
3. **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and fallback behavior
4. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed unnecessary complexity around local server management

## Testing

The Pollinations AI API was tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ Image generation from Pollinations API
- ✅ Base64 conversion for web compatibility
- ✅ Proper error handling

## Usage

The Pollinations AI integration now works seamlessly in web browsers:
1. Create a new project
2. The system will automatically generate a blueprint-style cover image
3. Images are uploaded to Supabase storage
4. No additional setup or local servers required

## Notes

- The Sharp library is still installed for potential Node.js usage
- TTS services still reference localhost but are not used in the image generation flow
- All core functionality (project creation, image generation, storage) works in web browsers
